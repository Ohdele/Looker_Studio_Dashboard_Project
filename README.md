# Insights into Technology Trends, Demographics, and Current Usage Patterns: A Comprehensive Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project provides a detailed analysis of job postings and developer trends, focusing on current technology usage, future technology trends, and demographic insights. Using data analysis techniques, visualizations, and dashboards, the project identifies key patterns and actionable insights to guide technology decision-making.

## Tools and Skills Used
- **Data Collection**: APIs, Web Scraping, Dataset Exploration
- **Data Wrangling**: Handling duplicates, missing values, and normalizing data
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Data distribution, outliers, and correlation analysis
- **Data Visualization**: Histograms, scatter plots, pie charts, bar charts, and dashboards
- **Dashboard Creation**: Google Looker Studio for interactive visualizations
- **Presentation**: PowerPoint for storytelling and summarizing findings

## Project Steps and Features
1. **Data Collection**:
   - Extracted job postings data via APIs and web scraping.
   - Explored and structured datasets for analysis.

2. **Data Wrangling**:
   - Identified and removed duplicates.
   - Handled missing values with appropriate imputations.
   - Normalized and structured data for consistency.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**:
   - Analyzed data distribution and handled outliers.
   - Identified correlations and key insights from datasets.

4. **Data Visualization**:
   - Visualized technology trends using stacked bar charts, scatter plots, and line charts.
   - Created pie charts and maps to highlight demographic distributions.

5. **Dashboard Creation**:
   - Built interactive dashboards using Google Looker Studio with three pages:
     - **Current Technology Usage**: Highlighting popular programming languages, databases, and platforms.
     - **Future Technology Trends**: Exploring desired technologies for the next year.
     - **Demographics**: Insights into gender, age, education, and country-level distributions.

6. **Presentation**:
   - Developed a compelling PowerPoint presentation to summarize findings.
   - Included additional charts and tables in the appendix for completeness.

## Key Findings
- **Current Technology Usage**:
  - Top programming languages, databases, and web frameworks in use today.
- **Future Technology Trends**:
  - Emerging technologies developers aspire to learn or use in the next year.
- **Demographics**:
  - Insights into developer demographics, including gender, education level, and geographic distribution.
